# Convert Contract to Markdown

Legal and compliance teams use this recipe to convert contract PDFs to structured markdown before feeding them into LLM analysis pipelines or clause extraction workflows.

## APIs Used

Document to Markdown (1 credit per page)

## Prerequisites

You need an Iteration Layer API key. Get one at [platform.iterationlayer.com](https://platform.iterationlayer.com) — free trial credits included, no credit card required.

For full integration guidance (SDKs, auth, MCP, error handling), see the [Iteration Layer Integration Guide](https://iterationlayer.com/SKILL.md).

## Implementation


```bash
curl -X POST https://api.iterationlayer.com/document-to-markdown/v1/convert \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "file": {
      "type": "url",
      "name": "contract.pdf",
      "url": "https://example.com/contracts/service-agreement-2026.pdf"
    }
  }'
```

```typescript
import { IterationLayer } from "iterationlayer";

const client = new IterationLayer({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

const result = await client.convertDocumentToMarkdown({
  file: {
    type: "url",
    name: "contract.pdf",
    url: "https://example.com/contracts/service-agreement-2026.pdf",
  },
});
```

```python
from iterationlayer import IterationLayer

client = IterationLayer(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

result = client.convert_document_to_markdown(
    file={
        "type": "url",
        "name": "contract.pdf",
        "url": "https://example.com/contracts/service-agreement-2026.pdf",
    }
)
```

```go
import il "github.com/iterationlayer/sdk-go"

client := il.NewClient("YOUR_API_KEY")

result, err := client.ConvertDocumentToMarkdown(il.ConvertDocumentToMarkdownRequest{
  File: il.NewFileFromURL(
    "contract.pdf",
    "https://example.com/contracts/service-agreement-2026.pdf",
